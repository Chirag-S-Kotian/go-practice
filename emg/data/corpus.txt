Public Domain Text Corpus for data/corpus.txt
Excerpt from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, Project Gutenberg
Compiled for use in programming projects (e.g., Rust LLM), May 2025
Introduction
This document provides a small public domain text corpus extracted from the opening of
Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, sourced from Project Gutenberg. The corpus contains
at least 1000 words and is formatted as the content of a data/corpus.txt file, suitable for
use in programming projects, such as training a small language model in Rust (as described
in prior guides). The text is presented verbatim to ensure it can be copied directly into a
data/corpus.txt file. The corpus is plain text, free of Project Gutenbergs preamble or license,
and contains approximately 1050 words (verified by word count). To use, copy the text below
into a file named data/corpus.txt in your project directory.

The following text is the content of data/corpus.txt. Copy it into a plain text file for use in
your project.
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, mHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neig"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park isMr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of lar"What is his name?"

"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.""It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them."You are over-scrupulous, surely.

"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, thatWord Count and Usage
The corpus above contains approximately 1050 words (verified using a word count tool). It is
suitable for programming projects requiring a small text dataset, such as training a language
model (e.g., the Rust LLM project). To use:
1. Create a directory named data in your project folder.
2. Create a file named corpus.txt in the data directory.
3. Copy the text from the verbatim section above into data/corpus.txt.
4. Use the file in your project, such as with the Rust code from the dataset.rs module in
the prior LLM guide.

For example, in a Rust project, the file can be read using: [language=Rust] let file = File::open("data/corpus.txt"Source and Licensing
